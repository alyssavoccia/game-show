# Game Show

This is the sixth project that I completed during the Frontend Techdegree program from Treehouse. Game Show is an interactive JavaScript game that allows users to choose letters to guess a random phrase on the game board. Make too many wrong guesses and it's game over.

You can view a live demo [here](https://alyssavoccia.github.io/game-show/).
